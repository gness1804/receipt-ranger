# Consider adding bot protection.

## Working directory

`~/Desktop/receipt-ranger`

## Contents

I think bot protection is a free feature of CloudFront that I can add to the Receipt Ranger. This would help harden security. Claude mentioned earlier that there was evidence of bots looking for weaknesses in WordPress, so I think that adding bot protection would be a good idea. 

## Acceptance criteria

<!-- DONE -->
