# Build Out Mvp Of The Project

## Working directory

`~/Desktop/receipt-ranger`

## Contents

We need to build out the MVP for this project. For details, see the first section of the document .cursor/init.md. 

Please first create a plan with steps, and let me approve the plan before doing any work. 

## Acceptance criteria

- An MVP application that takes in receipt images and emits a Google Sheets-compatible table with the data. 
- Application will use BAML to process the receipts and make sure that they're in a strict data format.
