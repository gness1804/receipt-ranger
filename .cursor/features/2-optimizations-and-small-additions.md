# Optimizations And Small Additions

## Working directory

`~/Desktop/receipt-ranger`

## Contents

We should add the following optimizations in small additions:

- Option to print out a TSV table of all receipts by calendar month, vendor, amount (over or under a certain amount), and category (Food/Restaurants, Clothes, etc). Also include an option to print out a TSV table of ALL receipts ever recorded. (This was none other than reprocessing all of the receipts, merely printing out a table of all of them.) 

## Acceptance criteria
