# Add a timeout to stop the infinite loading after a certain time

## Working directory

`~/Desktop/receipt-ranger`

## Contents

Currently when there is a problem with the application, there is often a loading screen which persists indefinitely. This makes for poor user experience. When the loading screen appears, there should be a timeout after which the application stops loading and displays an error message to the user. This would make for a much better user experience than simply having the app indefinitely hanging.

## Acceptance criteria
