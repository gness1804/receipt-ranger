# Visual bug: The site doesn't properly scroll on Google Chrome.

## Working directory

`~/Desktop/receipt-ranger`

## Contents

When I'm on the production website in Google Chrome and I enter my API key and enter the receipt, I can't scroll down to the place where I actually press the process receipt button unless I make the screen really small. Trying to scroll down on normal screen size just gets stuck. It won't scroll any further. 

Scrolling does seem to work in Safari, however. 

See this screenshot below from Chrome.
