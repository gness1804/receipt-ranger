# Remove button and Clear All button don't work

## Working directory

`~/Desktop/receipt-ranger`

## Contents

The Remove button does not do anything. When there is a selected receipt file and I click remove, it does not remove the receipt; it just fails silently.

Same for the Clear All button. 


## Acceptance criteria


- When there is a receipt selected and I click Remove, it should remove that receipt.
- When there is a receipt selected or multiple receipts selected and I click Clear All, it should remove all of them.
