# Visual bug: micro interaction for successful API key entry has excessive space.

## Working directory

`~/Desktop/receipt-ranger`

## Contents

When you go to the app and you successfully enter in an API key, it gives you a micro interaction, which is a green box saying "API key configured". There's too much spacing around the box; the spacing needs to be removed, and the green box probably needs to be centered. See the screenshot for what's broken.
