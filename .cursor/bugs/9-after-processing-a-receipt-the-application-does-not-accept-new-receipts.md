# After processing a receipt, the application does not accept new receipts

## Working directory

`~/Desktop/receipt-ranger`

## Contents

After successfully processing a receipt, when you try to add another receipt image, the application doesn't work. It just seems to be stuck. Only a page re-refresh solves this behavior and allows the app to work again. 

## Acceptance criteria:

- After processing a receipt successfully, the application will be able to process new receipts successfully without a page refresh.
