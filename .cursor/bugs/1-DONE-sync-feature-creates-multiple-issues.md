# Sync feature creates multiple issues

## Working directory

`~/Desktop/receipt-ranger`

## Contents

The cfs sync feature seems to be creating multiple issues. It often happens when working with an AI agent so I'm not sure whether the problem's with the agent or with the CFS application. Often when I try to close out an issue or run sync, I see multiple of the same issue, sometimes with the same number. We need to look into this potential bug and also make it harder to create CFS issues with the same numbers. The ID should be unique.

## Acceptance criteria
