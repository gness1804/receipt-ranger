# Columns are misaligned in output. Need to add back empty middle column.

## Working directory

`~/Desktop/receipt-ranger`

## Contents

In the backend-only version of the app, we had a middle column that was blank in order for the output to match the setup on Google Sheets. The blank spot was a placeholder for the who paid column in the actual spreadsheet but this block and this empty column are not being added in the actual app, the front end app. We need to fix that.

## Acceptance criteria
