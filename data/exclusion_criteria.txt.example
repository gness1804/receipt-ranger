# Receipt Exclusion Criteria
# --------------------------
# This file defines conditions under which receipts should be excluded from
# the output table (but still included in JSON output and deduplication).
#
# Copy this file to exclusion_criteria.txt and customize with your own rules.
# The exclusion_criteria.txt file is gitignored to protect sensitive data.
#
# Write rules in plain English. The LLM will interpret these when processing
# receipts. Be specific about what should trigger exclusion.
#
# Examples:
# - Exclude receipts from vendor "Internal Expense" as these are reimbursements
# - Exclude any receipt where the payment method includes a card ending in 1234
# - Exclude receipts with amount of exactly $0.00
# - Exclude receipts from category "Gifts & Donations" that exceed $500
#
# Add your exclusion rules below this line:
